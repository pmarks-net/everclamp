## Specification

Everclamp is a specification for an array of threaded holes:

- Thread pattern: M6x1
- Grid spacing: 25/3 mm (8.333 mm) center to center

## Why these values?
M6 bolts use a 1mm thread pitch, which is just coarse enough to be practical for 3D printing threaded holes and thumbscrews.  The closest possible spacing for such an array is about 8mm, so we're looking for a nearby value that aligns to nice metric grids like 100x100 mm.  In theory, Everclamp is compatible with [VESA MIS-F M6]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Display_Mounting_Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Display_Mounting_Interface#Variants)) if you print a large enough array.
